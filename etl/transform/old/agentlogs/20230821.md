* TODO: USCCB has events past October now, so I need to rerun part of the agent
* Then fix errors.
* I ran the agent on tmp-witherrors-orig.json to get the missing events filled out.
  * I am now deleting Advent and beyond (12/1/24 and after)
  * I am now copying the November events to data/LCAPI-USA-2024-transformed.json and manually fixing errors
  * DONE. data/LCAPI-USA-2024-transformed[-min].json now contain November events as well
* TODO: It looks like LCAPI output some garbage around Epiphany, this still needs to be fixed.
* saving LCPAPI-USA-2024-transformed as LCAPI-USE-2024-transformed-withepiphanyerrors and manually fixing Epiphany errors. After this, the "transformed" file should be final and I can minify it and test it in app.
* TODO: 2024-01-06 is broken. When I minify it says "no event for date 2024-01-06". It looks like LCAPI spit out a SatMemBVM1 and StAndreBessette, and a Epiphany Vigil, but no "Christmas Weekday" which is what should be there according to USCCB. Manually adding it
* NOTE: when I downloaded the readings/010624.cfm for that broken Saturday, the Gospel ended in 'or"' because of how the HTML split the two Gospel options. I am removing the ' or' at the end. It also appeared in a couple other Gospel texts in the json file, which I fixed.
* TODO: litcal-darwin is missing the last week of 2023 for some reason (Christmas week). Need to fix this
* The error seems to be in the header of the 2023 files. The litSeasons object does not contain a Christmas season for 2024
* While fixing this, I noticed the 2023 file used in litcal-darwin has changes that are not reflected in the litcal-agent/data folder.
* NOTE: moving forward, I should try to mirror the files in data/ to what's being used in the litcal-darwin app. However, once the data is in litcal-darwin, I guess it's hard not to treat it as canonical.
* On that note, a lot of martyr feasts in 2023 were changed from white to red (says "white" in litcal-agent/data, but "red" in litcal-darwin/Resources)...
* TODO: should I check martyr feasts for 2024?
* checked, looks good as is
* TODO: Assumption in 2024 is broken: no Gospel!
* TODO: maybe remove 2022 from app now? only support 2 years at a time?
