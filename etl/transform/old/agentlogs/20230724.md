* TODO: loader.c to go from JSON to sqlite
* each LDay has 1 and only 1 LCelebration
* an LDay (liturgical day) represents a day in a liturgical year. It is tied to a secular date
* An LDay is part of a liturgical season. An LDay in December 2023 is part of the 2024 liturgical year (specifically, Advent of that LYear)
* A Liturgical Day can have multiple Mass celebrations to choose from, but our agent ensures only 1 is output after minification.
* The loader, then, sees a list of incoming celebrations with secular dates on them. From this data, it can create the liturgical seasons, days, and celebrations for the liturgical year.
* What I need to do is port over the loader from LitCal, but at the point where
  it loads the data into a htable, it instead loads the data into sqlite
* the queries the app will make:
  * Given a secular date, what is the celebration? `select * from lcel join lday on lcel.lday_id = lday.id where lday.sec_date = ?`
  * the above query is done when a date is loaded (from the calwheel)
  * The other query is to get the first date and the last date of what's in the database. this'll be something like `select min(start_date), max(end_date) from lyear`
  * maybe get all the LYears and do a sanity check make sure there are no gaps, although that should take care of itself when the CalWheel is loaded.
* Next, I need to ship the app with the sqlite database instead of the JSON files.
* In the future, the database data could be fetched over the wire.
