* TODO: Assumption in 2024 is broken: no Gospel!
  * the error was that in the for-loop going through the page's HTML, the search was finding a 'hr.name' element, but it was empty.
  * the empty hr.name element caused the loop searching for the gospel to run, but no gospel text to be saved
  * the fix is to check for an empty gospel after the for-loop
  * Fixed the Assumption
* TODO: maybe remove 2022 from app now? only support 2 years at a time?
