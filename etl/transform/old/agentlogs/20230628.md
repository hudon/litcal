* NOTE: I'm using a new architecture where the data will now be stored in a SQLite database file.
  This database will be shipped with the litcal-darwin app.
  Therefore, the agent's role will be to manage the database and ETL data into it. This happens through
  a dbmigrate tool (evolves the db's schema), an extract-transform tool (under __init__.py), and a data
  loading tool (loader.c).
* The data for 2024 was pulled from https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com using the USA calendar
* I saved the calendar under `data/LCAPI-USA-2024.json`
* I ran `python3 __init__.py data/LCAPI-USA-2024.json transform > tmp.json`
* The resulting dataset had a few bad URLs and missing Gospels. The biggest problem is all of November 2024 is missing (and later).
* TODO: manually clean the data and then write the loader
