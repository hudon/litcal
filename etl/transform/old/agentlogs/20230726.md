* the output file needs to be minified for it to be load-able (because excess events are deleted when minifying)
* minification might create more errors that you then must also fix
* TODO: fix the errors in data/LCAPI-USA-2024
* TODO: NOTE that USCCB didn't have readings past October, so the cutoff will be earlier than expected.
* the errors are because LCAPI generated days after epiphany, but in 2024 actually there are no "days after Epiphany", 
  because the Baptism of our Lord happens on Monday the 8th (Epiphany is on Sunday the 7th).
