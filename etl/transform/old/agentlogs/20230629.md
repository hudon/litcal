* taking tmp.json and fixing the errors manually before saving it in data/ dir
* For link https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/021824.cfm, the problem is USCCB has put
  a "1" in the url, so the ending is 0218124.cfm. I'm wondering if I fix the url and I rerun
  the python script, will it refetch all gospels or just the missing ones?
* copying tmp.json to tmp-witherrors.json, so I can delete the error messages from tmp.json, fix
  some errors, then rerun
  the agent on it
* finished addressing all the error messages and reran the agent on tmp-witherrors.json. Now tmp.json is "fixed" according to the agent
* TODO: fix Holy Saturday (doesn't exist yet). Then merge with the 2024 liturgical events that are at the end of the 2023 secular year
