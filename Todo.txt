get real data into app
have something automatically format and lint C, and Objective-C code (like I had in VSCode). Do it on save.
add the right compiler flags and warnings to build step
write styleguide for C, Go, and Objective-C. include difference between comments and doc comments (eg. // and ///)
add C error tests,
remove typedefs. setup my own styleguide. Maybe try to align my Go style with C style (eg. for camelCase versus snake_case?) on second thought, each language can have its own style...

add ui tests
