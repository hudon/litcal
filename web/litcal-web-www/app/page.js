					On another occasion, Jesus began to teach by the sea. A very large
					crowd gathered around him so that he got into a boat on the sea and
					sat down. And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land. And he
					taught them at length in parables, and in the course of his
					instruction he said to them, &quot;Hear this! A sower went out to sow.
					And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and
					ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil.
					It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. And when the sun
					rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots. Some seed
					fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it and it
					produced no grain. And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit.
					It came up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty, and a
					hundredfold.&quot; He added, &quot;Whoever has ears to hear ought to
					hear.&quot; And when he was alone, those present along with the Twelve
					questioned him about the parables. Jesus said to them, &quot;Do you
					not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the
					parables? The sower sows the word. These are the ones on the path
					where the word is sown. As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once and
					takes away the word sown in them. And these are the ones sown on rocky
					ground who, when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy. But
					they have no roots; they last only for a time. Then when tribulation
					or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
					Those sown among thorns are another sort. They are the people who hear
					the word, but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches, and the craving for
					other things intrude and choke the word, and it bears no fruit. But
					those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it
					and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.&quot;
